        description="I am a Software Engineer and a Psychology student.
         I began my career in backend development at 2021 and then, I
         transitioned into data analysis. During this journey, I discovered
         Elixir and the BEAM languages through university studies and the Stack
         Overflow survey, where Elixir and Phoenix were highlighted as beloved
         language / framework. Currently, I work at Peer Stritzinger GmbH, a
         company deeply committed to the BEAM ecosystem. It specialize in
         developing embedded systems (GRiSP), cloud-to-edge distributed
         platforms (GRiSP.io), European projects like RESCALE, and also
         provides consultancy services.

        creative processes, and the need for communication and community.
        I run a private practice in San Jos√©, providing therapy and developing
        treatment plans. My journey into psychology began with a Licentiate
        from UCACIS and a diploma in Art Therapy from UAM, sparking my interest
        in connecting psychoanalysis with art. In 2015, I co-founded Kunsthilft
        in Berlin, offering therapeutic art workshops for refugee children. I
        combine my expertise in psychology with project management, bringing
        a unique perspective to my work."
