        description="I am a Software Engineer and a psychology student. Inspired by the
         kindness and collaboration spirit of the Elixir community, I‚Äôm dedicated
         to cultivating that same culture of kindness and cooperation into every thing I do.
         I began my career in backend development with Kotlin and Spring Boot
         at a pet health insurance startup, and then, I transitioned into data
         analysis. During this journey, I discovered Elixir and the BEAM languages through
         university studies and the Stack Overflow survey, where Elixir and Phoenix
         were highlighted as beloved frameworks. Now, I work at Peer Stritzinger GmbH,
         focusing on Erlang solutions for embedded systems."

        creative processes, and the need for communication and community.
        I run a private practice in San Jos√©, providing therapy and developing
        treatment plans. My journey into psychology began with a Licentiate
        from UCACIS and a diploma in Art Therapy from UAM, sparking my interest
        in connecting psychoanalysis with art. In 2015, I co-founded Kunsthilft
        in Berlin, offering therapeutic art workshops for refugee children. I
        combine my expertise in psychology with project management, bringing
        a unique perspective to my work."
